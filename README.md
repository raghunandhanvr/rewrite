### Paraphraser

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app). The Paraphraser application allows users to easily transform their text while maintaining its original meaning. It offers various paraphrasing styles to choose from, making it a versatile tool for content writing, SEO, and more. And the response would be pretty fast as it comes from Groq.

First, run the development server:

```bash
pnpm i
pnpm dev
```
